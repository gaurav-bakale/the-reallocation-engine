# search/gaps.md — the delta between my record and my freelance target

> Agent-drafted (INFO 7375 setup exercise). The gap is between what `resume.json` proves and
> what winning AI-doable freelance build gigs (categories `web · database · data-ml`) actually
> demand. Every gap cites checkable evidence — a real posting, a pattern across postings, or the
> gig-scorer's own logic. Feelings go in `private-notes.md`, not here.

| # | Gap | Evidence the target demands it | What I have | Plan to close it (a shippable output) |
|---|-----|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 | No freelance-platform track record / client reviews | `gig-scorer.mjs` weights `client_trust` 0.25; real "Senior Independent" contractor postings hire proven independents ([remotive 1919266](https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-development/senior-independent-ai-engineer-architect-1919266), [1919265](https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/software-development/senior-independent-software-developer-1919265)); Upwork ranks by Job Success Score | 6 yrs full-time engineering; **0** freelance reviews / no JSS | Deliver 1–2 small fixed-price gigs to earn first reviews → **a completed, publicly-rated gig** |
| 2 | No packaged public portfolio for web/build gigs | Build gigs ask for a live demo / portfolio link (pattern across web build gigs, e.g. the "React demo landing page" gig type in `gigs.sample.json`) | GuitarZero (live: guitarzero.vercel.app) + PulseFrame — not packaged for clients | Ship a one-page portfolio linking GuitarZero + 2 mini case studies → **a published portfolio URL** |
| 3 | Limited weekly availability vs fast-turnaround gigs | `time_fit` is a hard gate in the scorer; many build gigs want < 3-day delivery | ~10 hrs/week (full-time MS student + job search) | Pre-build reusable starters (landing-page template, Postgres-schema generator, RAG/agent boilerplate) → **a reusable template repo** that cuts delivery time |
| 4 | Free-board "data-ml" demand is labeling/rating, not senior LLM builds | Real Remotive `data-ml` postings are ["Data Labeling Specialists"](https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/data/data-labeling-specialists-2090903) and ["QA Rater – German"](https://remotive.com/remote-jobs/all-others/quality-assurance-rater-german-germany-2090988) — low-fit for my skills | Strong LLM/agent/RAG skills (co-op agent platform, PulseFrame) | Target paid LLM/RAG/chatbot build gigs on Upwork/Contra, or productize an "AI agent / RAG starter" → **a published gig listing** |
| 5 | No freelance pricing / positioning history | Clients gauge rate by track record; `budget_floor_usd` in profile.yml needs justification | Full-time comp benchmark ($170–220k) but no freelance rate proof | Set an intro rate + collect 1 testimonial from a first delivered gig → **a rate card backed by 1 delivered gig** |

## Step 3 — my two required edits (do these before submitting)

**(a) Kill one row.** Delete the one gap above that does **not** actually apply to my situation, and write one sentence on why it was wrong (a *reason*, not "not relevant to me").

> _TODO (your words): I'm deleting row __ because ______._

**(b) Rewrite one row in my own words.** Take the gap that matters most and restate it — the
evidence, what I have, and the plan — in language that reflects my real understanding, not the
agent's extraction.

> _TODO (your words): ______._

---
_Evidence is checkable: posting links are live Remotive URLs from my own scan; the scorer claims
(`client_trust` weight, `time_fit` gate) are in `scripts/score/gig-scorer.mjs`; the "demo/portfolio"
demand is a pattern across the web build-gig fixtures. Anything I can't ground, I should kill or move
to private-notes.md._
